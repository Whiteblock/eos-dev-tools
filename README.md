# EOSIO Development Resources

I had a lot of trouble finding adequate documentation and resources related to EOS development, so I put all of this together for my own use. The following presents some of the stuff I've figured out that wasn't entirely clear in the [documentation provided by EOS](https://developers.eos.io/).

The Dockerfile creates a static binary without any external dependencies. The resulting image should be around 380mb in size and work out of the box as a vanilla EOS build.

You can also pull this image directly from Docker Hub with `docker pull whiteblock/eosio`.

I've included the `Makefile` and an example `config.init` for reference. I also modified the build script for development and testing purposes and removed any hardcoded requirements for resource allocation.

If you have any issues, please feel free to share them here and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to [contact me on Telegram](https://t.me/zcole). 

## Dependencies: 
- Boost
- Cmake
- Clang
- LLVM
- OpenSSL
- secp256k1-zkp

## Overview

`nodesos` is the primary EOS client which allows users to implement different functionality within their node via the EOS plugin library. Manages account actions and publishing.   

`cleos` is the command line interface which acts as a bridge between the blockchain network and the user's local environment via REST API. Accesses wallets which store public-private key pairs and interacts with `nodeos` and `keosd`. Launches `keosd` when you run it with a subcommand. If `keosd` is still running from a previous instance, it'll give you problems, which is annoying and weird, so run `pkill keosd` to kill all instances or `ps aux | grep keosd` and then kill the process ID. `cleos` is also responsible for creating accounts, which is done by sending a request to `nodeos`. 
 
`keosd` is a wallet management utility. When creating a new wallet, the master password is output to the command line in hexadecimal format beginning with a PW prefix, like so: `PW5JQwauDUuAWFyCYdMCuqGRc28oN3PcPLivfWvBxkhjYZ7Gw53a8`. Be sure to save this because it won't be stored anywhere else.     

### Plugins

These plugins can either be specified for automatic implementation within the `config.ini` file or manually specified as a user flag when launching `nodeos`. 

- `bnet_plugin` is used to ensure synchronization between multiple nodes. [Details](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/docs/bnet_plugin)  
`chain_plugin` manages the collection and processing of blockchain related data. [Details](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/docs/chain_plugin)  
- `http_plugin` manages the RPC API. [Details](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/docs/http_plugin)  
`chain_api_plugin` acts as a bridge between the `chain_plugin` and `http_plugin` to allow RPC API interaction. [Details](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/docs/chain_api_plugin)  
- `net_plugin` manages a node's ability to connect to the outside world, interact within the network, and peer with other nodes. [Details](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/docs/net_plugin)  
- `producer_plugin` allows a node to act as block producer. [Details](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/docs/producer_plugin)
- `wallet_plugin` allows a node to interact with a wallet.  

### Commands 

- `cleos create key -f $FILENAME` creates a new key and outputs it to the specified file. If you want to output your key to the command line, replace the `-f $FILENAME` flag with `--to-console`.  

- `cleos wallet create -n <name> --to-console` creates a new wallet and outputs to command line.
